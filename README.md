Repository for udacity deep learning nanodegree projects


* In Project 1, I train a deep learning model to predict the daily bike rental ridership

* In Project 2, I train a convolutional neural network to classify images.

* In Project 3, I generate new scripts for the simpsons using RNNs

* In Project 4, I use a sequence to sequence model to translate sentences from English to French

* In Project 5: I train a generative adversarial network to generate new faces

Each project has its own readme.
